What is ScoreSaber?
--------
Score Saber is a website/mod for the popular VR game Beat Saber please check out the offical website here https://scoresaber.com. For this website I used their API to request data from an ID.

This website was only to take what I already knew about javascript and use it in real world, I am still trying to learn more about web development.

Current Issues
-------------
- **API requests bypasses CORS protection |**
  I am very much aware I should not be bypassing CORS through a proxy but because this is only used to show public data and no real personal information is being passed through the API or Proxy
